This project is a little bit different than the usual projects
everything is an object
look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>>

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>>

 First read, then think, then brainstorm together. Only then you can test in the
 interpreter.
